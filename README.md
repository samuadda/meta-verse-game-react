# 🎮 Metaverse Game Landing – React + Vite + Tailwind + GSAP

This project is a **metaverse gaming landing page** built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **GSAP** for animations.  
It was my first serious React project where I focused on building a visually rich, animated hero section and smooth scrolling experience.

The UI is inspired by modern gaming/metaverse websites with bold typography, full-screen hero video/image, and interactive sections.
